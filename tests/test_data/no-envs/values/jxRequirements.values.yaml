versions:
  # we only set this value to ensure that the CronJob definitions are deterministic
  # (since the version number for the jx-boot pod changes regularly)
  # we set the versions of jx & updatebot to TESTVAL
  # in order to ensure tests are deterministic
  # (templated file content doesn't change just because new versions are released)
  jx: TESTVAL
  updatebot: TESTVAL
